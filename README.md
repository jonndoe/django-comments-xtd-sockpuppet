#This is tutorial project of django-comments-xtd. Sockpuppet is added for testing purposes.


### To run this project you have to set up python and nodejs virtual enviroments.
One of good choises for managing virtual enviromens is Miniconda.
It supports having isolated python as well as nodejs enviroments. 
- Install miniconda on your Linux machine.
- Create single virtual enviroment for python and nodejs in one shot: `conda create --name env38_python_nodejs python=3.8 nodejs`
- Activate virtual enviroment: `conda activate env38_python_nodejs`
- Check python version: `python --version`
- Check nodejs version: `node --version`

Now you can install all required dependencies for the project (nodejs and python):

- `pip install -f requirements.txt`
- `npm install`
